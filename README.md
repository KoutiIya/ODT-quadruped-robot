# ODT-quadruped-robot
3D model files, code, circuit, components of a robot dog
This project documents the process of designing, building, and testing a small quadruped robot. It did not succeed, but it is a documentation nonetheless. 

ðŸ“š Overview
	â€¢	Goal: Build a functional four-legged walking robot using an ESP32, servo motors, and custom-designed mechanical parts.
	â€¢	Challenges: Stability, joint design, gait, etc.
	â€¢	Outcome: A physical prototype that could stand, move slightly, but needs major improvements in stability, weight distribution, and mechanical joints.
